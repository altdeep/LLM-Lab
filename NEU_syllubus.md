This Northeastern University syllabus for the course Building Applications on Large Language Models.  The schedule is subject to adjustment.  Please check frequently to stay updated.  Video lectures and readings should be read/viewed prior to class.

## Overview

A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that is trained on a large dataset of text data.
LLMs are able to generate human-like text and can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering.
Some examples of large language models include GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

An LLM is an example of a foundation model -- a large artificial intelligence model trained on a vast quantity of unlabeled data at scale resulting in a model that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.
AI-savvy software engineers build software applications that automate these downstream tasks.
This software generally access pretrained language models through services such as Azure OpenAI Service and Hugging Face.
If the pretrained models available through these services don't quite fit your application's needs, you can fine-tune them on your own data, or using techniques such as RLHF.

This goal is a guided exploration of building applications on LLMs.
You will write and present case studies in LLM-driven business applications.
You will build your own LLM-driven business application as a class project.
And you will present that work to your peers.

## Grading and Academic Guidelines

The final grade for this course will be weighted as follows:

    Case Study Design and Presention:
    Quiz Questions:
    Class Project (Prototype Development):
    Class Project (Case Study and Presentation): 

Refresh your knowledge of the university's [policy](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/) about academic integrity and plagiarism (this includes plagarizing code). There is **zero-tolerance** for cheating!

# Suggested Prerequisites

Prerequisites include (DS5220 and DS5230) or (CS6140 and CS6220) or approval of the instructor.

You will gain the most from this course if you:

* You are comfortable using a programming language to build a web or mobile application that connect to 3rd party APIs.
* You are generally familiar with natural language processing and large language models.
* You a good software engineer or aspire to be one.
* You are interested in building applications using using foundation models

## Online Course Materials and Readings

Students will be provided access to the online course. Students should go through the online course in advance of class.  This will increase the quality of the classes and allow you to absorb more during class time.

The online lectures provide links to external papers for more in-depth readings.  Students are expected to read the assigned readings in advance of each lecture.

Learning to read papers is a skill that needs practice.  Check out [the three pass method](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) or simply Google "how to read a paper" to learn more.
